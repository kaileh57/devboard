# 10/20/25 Laid out the schematic

Following the devboard tutorial to hopefully learn some real skills!
I made quite a few mistakes, but in the end the ERC is finally showing clear (well apart from the errors the tutorial told me to ignore)
I THINK i wired everything correctly, if you see something wrong lmk on slack! :)+

Pretty sure this is technically better than a pico cuz it has more IO

# 11/27/25 Applied footprints!

Assigned footprints, also fixed a minor issue with the crystal oscillator...

Took a while as I originally had named stuff in a slightly unserious way and ended up having to redo the names.

It's also been a while since i touched this project, but I finally have time!

# 11/27/25 Routed the PCB
<img width="327" height="773" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff263d25-d2a3-4d6e-85af-a834bd8bc4c4" />
Routed the PCB!!

Took MANY attempts to get it right, and a whole bunch of trial and error, but the DRC now passes! apart from like a billion warnings.
Next time is silkscreen

# 11/28/25 Finished up!

Made some minor tweaks and did all the silkscreening, plus the hell that is JLCPCB :)

Everything SHOULD be ready to order (i hope), and its time to move on to bigger and better things!
Things that just might be powered by this devboard...

# 12/8/25 Added LEDs!
To make the project a bit more unique, I added 4 LEDs! The LEDs are attached to GPIO pins 14-17, and are designed for that voltage (3.3v).
These LEDs can either be a fun blinker for data flow, or an actual built in programmable status LED, and wait, there's four!!
