# devboard

I've finally gotten BACK into PCB design!!

This project heavily expands on my previous work both in scope and complexity. 
It's an RP2040 devboard, which I hope to use for other projects. This was definetly outside of my comfort zone (I'm a software guy) but I got it done in the end after many many hours of routing traces :(
Looking forward to the next project, which is hopefully more complex!
I also labeled each pin, as my past use of devboards in class has required a lot of referencing the design spec, which I hope to cut down here.

Feel free to use this devboard! It's MIT, but I'd appreciate at least a nod if you find it useful.
